There is an integer array which has the following features:

* The numbers in adjacent positions are different.
* A\[0\] &lt; A\[1\] && A\[A.length - 2\] &gt; A\[A.length - 1\].

We define a position P is a peek if:

```
A[P] >A[P-1] && A[P] > A[P+1]

```

Find a peak element in this array. Return the index of the peak.

##### Notice

* It's guaranteed the array has at least one peak.
* The array may contain multiple peeks, find any of them.
* The array has at least 3 numbers in it.

**Example**

Given`[1, 2, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 6]`

Return index`1`\(which is number 2\) or`6`\(which is number 7\)
