Given an array and a window size that is sliding along the array, find the sum of the count of unique elements in each window

**Example**

Given a array nums =`[1, 2, 1, 3, 3]`and`k = 3`

First window`[1, 2, 1]`, only`2`is unique, count is 1.  
Second window`[2, 1, 3]`, all elements unique, count is 3.  
Third window`[1, 3, 3]`, only`1`is unique, count is 1.  
sum of count =`1 + 3 + 1 = 5`

Return`5`
