Write a function that add two numbers A and B. You should not use`+`or any arithmetic operators.

##### Notice

There is no need to read data from standard input stream. Both parameters are given in function`aplusb`, you job is to calculate the sum and return it.



**Clarification**

Are a and b both`32-bit`integers?

* Yes.

Can I use bit operation?

* Sure you can.

**Example**

Given`a=1`and`b=2`return`3`



```java
public class Solution {
    /*
     * @param : An integer
     * @param : An integer
     * @return: The sum of a and b
     */
    public int aplusb(int a, int b) {
        while(b != 0){
            int carry = a & b;
             a = a ^ b;
             b = carry << 1;
         }
         return a;
    }
};
```
